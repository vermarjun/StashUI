            A UI (User Interface) component is a modular, reusable element that serves a specific
            function within a graphical user interface. Examples include buttons, input fields,
            dropdown menus, sliders, and checkboxes.

            Why are UI components important?
          </AccordionHeader>
          <AccordionPanel>
            UI components promote consistency, efficiency, and scalability in software development.
            They allow developers to reuse code, maintain a consistent look and feel across an
            application, and easily make updates or modifications without affecting the entire
            system.

        <AccordionItem value='item-3' className='w-full dark:bg-black bg-white'>
          <AccordionHeader className='dark:text-neutral-300 dark:hover:text-black'>
            Key characteristics of UI components?
          </AccordionHeader>
          <AccordionPanel>
            Well-designed UI components should be modular, customizable, and accessible. They should
            have clear and intuitive functionality, be easily styled to match the overall design
            language of the application.
